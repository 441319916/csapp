%%COMMENT:6:8:High-level cache miss rate analysis:
\begin{problem}{8}

You are writing a new 3D game that you hope will earn you fame and
fortune.  You are currently working on a function to blank the screen
buffer before drawing the next frame.  The screen you are working with
is a 640x480 array of pixels. The machine you are working on has a
64 KB direct mapped cache with 4 byte lines. The C structures you are
using are:

\begin{verbatim}
struct pixel {
    char r;
    char g;
    char b;
    char a;
};

struct pixel buffer[480][640];
register int i, j;
register char *cptr;
register int *iptr;
\end{verbatim}

Assume:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb|sizeof(char) = 1|
\item \verb|sizeof(int) = 4|
\item \verb|buffer| begins at memory address 0
\item The cache is initially empty.
\item The only memory accesses are to the entries of the array \verb|buffer|. 
Variables \verb|i|, \verb|j|, \verb|cptr|, and \verb|iptr| are stored in registers.
\end{itemize}

\end{problem}

A. What percentage of the writes in the following code will miss in the cache?

\begin{verbatim}
for (j=0; j < 640; j++) {
    for (i=0; i < 480; i++){
        buffer[i][j].r = 0;
        buffer[i][j].g = 0;
        buffer[i][j].b = 0;
        buffer[i][j].a = 0;
    }
}
\end{verbatim}

B. What percentage of the writes in the following code will miss in the cache?

\begin{verbatim}
char *cptr;
cptr = (char *) buffer;
for (; cptr < (((char *) buffer) + 640 * 480 * 4); cptr++)
    *cptr = 0;
\end{verbatim}

C. What percentage of the writes in the following code will miss in the cache?

    *iptr = 0;
