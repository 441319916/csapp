    <h1>Performance Lab Release Notes</h1>

<h2>6/26/2003</h2>
<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug in the <kbd>grade-perflab.pl</kbd> 
autograder. The autograder was failing because it tried
to call two scoring functions defined in the 
<kbd>config.pm</kbd> module. Somehow I had accidently 
deleted the '<kbd>use config</kbd>' statement that 
included this module.
</ul>

<h2>6/3/2002</h2>
<ul>
<li> Initial release.
</ul>
