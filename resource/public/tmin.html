<h1>Summary</h1>

Due to one of the rules for processing integer constants in ANSI C,
the numeric constant <kbd>-2147483648</kbd> is handled in a peculiar
way on a 32-bit, two's complement machine.
<p>
The problem can be corrected by writing
<kbd>-2147483647-1</kbd>, rather than
<kbd>-2147483648</kbd> in any C code.

<h1>Description of Problem</h1>

The ANSI C standard requires that an integer constant too large to be
represented as a signed integer be ``promoted'' to an unsigned value.
When GCC encounters the value 2147483648, it gives a warning message:
``<kbd>warning: decimal constant is so large that it is
unsigned</kbd>.''  The result is the same as if the value had been
written <kbd>2147483648U</kbd>.
<p>
The compiler processes an expression of the form <kbd>-</kbd><em>X</em> 
by first reading the expression <em>X</em> and then
negating it.  Thus, when the C compiler encounters the constant
<kbd>-2147483648</kbd>, it first processes <kbd>2147483648</kbd>,
yielding <kbd>2147483648U</kbd>, and then negates it.  The unsigned
negation of this value is also <kbd>2147483648U</kbd>.  The bit
pattern is correct, but the type is wrong!

<h1>Writing TMin in Code</h1>

The ANSI C standard states that the maximum and minimum integers
should be declared as constants <kbd>INT_MAX</kbd> and
<kbd>INT_MIN</kbd> in the file <kbd>limits.h</kbd>.  Looking at
this file on an IA32 Linux machine (in the directory
<kbd>/usr/include</kbd>), we find the following declarations:
<p>
<pre>
/* Minimum and maximum values a `signed int' can hold.  */
#define INT_MAX	2147483647
#define INT_MIN	(-INT_MAX - 1)
</pre>
<p>
This method of declaring <kbd>INT_MIN</kbd> avoids accidental
promotion and also avoids any warning messages by the C compiler about
integer overflow.

<p>
The following are ways to write TMin_32 for a 32-bit machine that give
the correct value and type, and don't cause any error messages:

<ul>
<li><kbd> -2147483647-1</kbd>
<li><kbd> (int) 2147483648U</kbd>
<li><kbd> 1<<31</kbd>
</ul>

The first method is preferred, since it indicates that the
result will be a negative number.
