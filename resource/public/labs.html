<b>Conditions of use: If you are an instructor with a CS:APP account,
then you have permission to download, inspect, and try out these labs.
However, you may use them in courses only if you have adopted the
CS:APP textbook.

<p>
This page contains a complete set of turnkey labs for the CS:APP
text. The labs all share some common features, described <a
href="labinfo.html">here</a>.

<p>
Each lab is distributed in a self-contained tar file and has been
compiled with GCC 2.95.3 and tested on a Linux/IA32 machine.  You will
need a <a
href="http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/public/loginrequest.html">CS:APP
account</a> to download the code. To untar <kbd>foo.tar</kbd>, type
"<kbd>tar xvf foo.tar</kbd>" to the Unix shell. This will create a
directory called "<kbd>foo</kbd>" that contains all of the material
for the lab. 

<p>
Labs that were updated after Sep 1, 2006 
are marked as <img alt="[NEW]" width=31 height=12 src="new.gif">.

<blockquote>
Students implement simple logical
and arithmetic functions, but using a highly restricted subset of C.
For example, they must compute the absolute value of a number using
only bit-level operations.  This lab helps students understand the
bit-level representations of C data types and the bit-level behavior
of the operations on data.

<blockquote>
A "binary bomb" is a program provided to students as an object code
file.  When run, it prompts the user to type in 6 different strings.
If any of these is incorrect, the bomb ``explodes,'' printing an error
message and logging the event on a grading server.  Students must
``defuse'' their own unique bomb by disassembling and reverse
engineering the program to determine what the 6 strings should be.
The lab teaches students to understand assembly language, and also
forces them to learn how to use a debugger.  It's also great fun. 
A legendary lab among the CMU undergrads. 
<p>
Here's a <a href="bomb.tar">Linux/IA32
binary bomb</a>
that you can try out for yourself. 
To download using either IE or Netscape, left click
and save to a file called <kbd>bomb.tar</kbd>. Then copy <kbd>bomb.tar</kbd>
to a Linux machine and expand into the binary executable <kbd>bomb</kbd> 
by typing "<kbd>tar xvf bomb.tar</kbd>". 
The feature that notifies the grading server has been 
disabled, so feel free to explode this bomb with impunity.
If you're an instructor with a CS:APP account, then 
you can download the

<blockquote>
Students modify the run-time behavior of a binary executable by
exploiting a buffer overflow bug. This lab teaches the students about
the stack discipline and teaches them about the danger of writing code
that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.

<blockquote>
Students are given a small default Y86 array copying function and a
working pipelined Y86 processor design that runs the copy function in
some nominal number of clock cycles per array element (CPE).  The
students attempt to minimize the CPE by modifying both the function
and the processor design. This gives the students a deep appreciation
for the interactions between hardware and software.
<p>
Note: The lab materials include the master source distribution of the Y86
processor simulators and the <em>Y86 Guide to Simulators</em>.

Students optimize the performance of an application
kernel function such as convolution or matrix transposition.  This lab
provides a clear demonstration of the properties of cache
memories and gives them experience with low-level program
optimization.

<blockquote>
Students implement their own simple Unix shell program with job
control, including the <kbd>ctrl-c</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl-z</kbd> 
keystrokes, <kbd>fg</kbd>, <kbd>bg</kbd>, and <kbd>jobs</kbd>
commands.  This is the students' first introduction to application
level concurrency, and gives them a clear idea of Unix process
control, signals, and signal handling.

<blockquote>
Students implement their own versions of <kbd>malloc</kbd>,
<kbd>free</kbd>, and <kbd>realloc</kbd>.  This lab gives students a
clear understanding of data layout and organization, and requires them
to evaluate different trade-offs between space and time
efficiency. One of our favorite labs. When students finish this one,
they really understand pointers!

<blockquote>
Students implement a concurrent Web proxy that sits between their
browser and the rest of the World Wide Web.  This lab exposes the
students to the interesting world of network programming, and ties
together many of the concepts from the course, such as byte ordering,
process control, signals, signal handling, file I/O, concurrency, and
synchronization.
