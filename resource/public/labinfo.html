    <h1>CS:APP Lab Overview</h1>

All CS:APP labs share the following features:
<ul>

<li> <b>Class tested at Carnegie Mellon.</b> The authors developed and
refined the labs over a period of 4 years, on classes of 150 students.
The course gets high evaluations from the students, who typically cite
the labs as the reason they love the course.

<li> <b>Automatic testing and evaluation drivers.</b> Students develop
their solution in a C file, which they then link into a C driver
program. The driver runs their solution, checks for correctness, and
produces a quantitative evaluation of their solution. Students use
this feedback to incrementally refine their solutions.

<li> <b>Solutions.</b> Instructors are provided with complete
solutions for each Lab.

<li> <b>Perl autograders.</b> Each lab (with the exception of the
Proxy Lab) comes with a Perl autograder that runs the driver program
on each student handin file and prints an ASCII grade sheet for each
student.

<li> <b>Complete lab writeups.</b> Each lab comes with a complete
writeup (in Latex) that provides context, step by step instructions,
and an explanation of the evaluation criteria.

</ul>
